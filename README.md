# BlazorCrud

BlazorCrud is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using the Blazor WebAssembly framework. It demonstrates how to perform basic CRUD operations with a .NET Core backend and a Blazor frontend.

- **Blazor WebAssembly**: Uses Blazor WebAssembly to build a single-page application (SPA) that runs on the client-side.
- **CRUD Operations**: Provides basic operations to create, read, update, and delete records in the application.
- **Entity Framework Core**: Utilizes EF Core for database operations, making it easy to connect to various databases.
- **REST API Integration**: The backend exposes a REST API that the Blazor frontend consumes.
- **Dependency Injection**: Implements dependency injection for services, ensuring modularity and separation of concerns.
- **Bootstrap Styling**: Includes Bootstrap for basic styling and responsive design.
